ChromeMeta
==========

Chrome extension to copy meta tags with one click.  
[Available on the Chrome Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gkjbdnpikaadopgjpkljlbbbebhglojg/)

Was porting a flatfile site to WordPress and got tired of manually finding and copying meta tags.  
Requires permissions on all sites so it can inject JS to read the page's head.

Thx to [@mrmrs](https://github.com/mrmrs) for the [sweet buttons](http://mrmrs.io/btns/), and [@altryne](https://github.com/altryne) for the [kickass boilerplate](http://extensionizr.com).
